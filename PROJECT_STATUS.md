- ✅ All necessary files moved to appropriate directories (`/docs`, `/deployment`)

### ✅ Sample Data & Testing
- ✅ Initial test users created:
  - Superadmin: `admin@edugrowhub.com` / `password123`
  - Teacher: `teacher@example.com` / `password123`
  - Student: `student@example.com` / `password123`
- ✅ Comprehensive API testing script created
- ✅ Complete API documentation provided

## 🚀 How to Start & Test

### 1. Start the Application
