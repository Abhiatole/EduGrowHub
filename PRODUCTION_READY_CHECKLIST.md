## üî• **FINAL DEPLOYMENT STEPS** (Execute in Order)

### Step 1: Prepare Production Environment
```bash
# 1. Set up environment variables in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
# 2. Configure RDS MySQL database
# 3. Set up domain in Route 53
# 4. Request SSL certificate in ACM
```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend to AWS EC2
```bash
# Execute backend deployment
chmod +x deploy-backend.sh
./deploy-backend.sh

# This will:
# - Set up EC2 instance with Java 17
# - Configure NGINX reverse proxy
# - Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt
# - Configure systemd service
# - Set up log rotation and monitoring
```

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend to AWS S3 + CloudFront
```bash
# Execute frontend deployment
chmod +x deploy-frontend.sh
./deploy-frontend.sh

# This will:
# - Create S3 bucket for static hosting
# - Set up CloudFront distribution
# - Configure custom domain and SSL
# - Upload build artifacts
```

### Step 4: Configure Domain and DNS
```bash
# 1. Point domain to CloudFront distribution in Route 53
# 2. Verify SSL certificate validation
# 3. Test HTTPS redirects
# 4. Configure API subdomain for backend
```

### Step 5: Final Testing and Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
./test-frontend.ps1      # Windows
./test-frontend.sh       # Linux/Mac

# Test complete user flow:
# 1. Student registration and login
# 2. Test taking and submission
# 3. Teacher login and dashboard
# 4. Report generation
# 5. WhatsApp notifications
```
